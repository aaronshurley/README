# Aaron Hurley
I'm the Team Lead for the CORE Infrastructure team in Chicago.

Some helpful information:
- he/him
- Filipino American
- Brady Bunch family (I'm the 4th oldest of 6)
- Grew up in Wisconsin (just north of Chicago) so I enjoy beer, cheese, brats, and the local sports teams (Packers, Bucks, Badgers, Brewers)
- Before moving to Chicago I was in San Francisco for ~10 years so I enjoy wine, avocados, burritos, tech, and overpriced coffee
- Living with my girlfriend and our two dogs in Chicago
- Introvert

# Strengths
- **Organization/Structure.** Organization and structure reduces my anxiety. Having a plan brings me peace. I enjoy getting into the details and edge cases. I like to create structures or processes when they can improve how things work and not add friction.
- **Critical Thinker.** I try to think critically when making decisions and base them on facts or principles. I try to understand the bigger picture and look at things systemically so that we address root causes and not symptoms.
- **Perpetual learner.** I know that I don't know a lot. I ask questions to chase my curiosity. I don't mind being wrong as long as I'm explained why. I like experimenting to see what we learn.

## How to leverage my strengths
- Ask me for help. I enjoy talking through challenges so that we can land on better solutions.
- Let me know of "areas of improvement" that we haven't invested enough time into. I always enjoy thinking about improving how teams work together.

# Weaknesses
- **Getting caught up in the details.** I might go down a rabbithole on a thing that catches my attention before it's necessary to dig that deep.
- **I struggle when there is _a lot_ of ambiguity (such as priorities).** I will generally try to disambiguate critical factors or make assumptions to move on. I don't like working on things that don't matter.
- **Technical expertise of our team's technologies.** I have a background as a dev for PaaS solutions so I know the domain and general needs but I don't have years of experience with much of the technologies that we use across CORE IS.

## How to support my weaknesses
- Bring me back to the surface. Tell me if I'm focusing too much on something that isn't important.
- Take time to explain things to me when I ask questions. I really like pictures/diagrams.

# Communication Preferences
- For feedback: **Directly and as soon as possible.** Preferrably verbal so that I can ask clarifying questions. I prefer to hear something that isn't polished sooner rather than hear something that is polished later.
- For urgent matters, call me. Otherwise, mattermost works.
